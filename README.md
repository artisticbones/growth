### The things I do
---
#### Day 14
Learn how to use markdown,before today,I`ve been submitting the code 10 times.  But I haven`t deployed locally written code to tomcat,the conversion between this is a bit of a hassle.I will learn how to use ant and use to war these code,so they will be in aliyun.
#### Day 15
Nowaday,I have deployed the code on aliyun,and adjust the codes in order to they can work on server.
#### Day 17
Accord the video to learn the httpservlet and genericservlet,and try to write the sample code on the video.
#### Day 18
Code my own Httpservlet and Genericservlet according to the video tutorial,in the process of writing not a video tutorial I have read more or less three times,it feels more and more difficult.
#### Day 19
Today,I learned how to connect a servlet programm to a database and encountered a permissions issue.Locally,the user is an ordinary user,but MySQL is possessed by the root user,and I haven't solved the problem yet.
#### Day 21
Today,I have learned the principle of the JSP file,it is essentially a servlet program,in the execution of the JSP engine to compile it into a servlet program.
#### Day 23
As of today,I have looked at a large part of the JSP and expect to be able to finish it learning tomorrow.Today,I realized the login successfully display pop-up window,but JSP script writing I am not quite clear,there is a diffculty has not been resovled,look forward to tomorrow can be resolved.
