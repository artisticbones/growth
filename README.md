### The things I do
---
#### Day 14
Learn how to use markdown,before today,I`ve been submitting the code 10 times.  But I haven`t deployed locally written code to tomcat,the conversion between this is a bit of a hassle.I will learn how to use ant and use to war these code,so they will be in aliyun.
#### Day 15
Nowaday,I have deployed the code on aliyun,and adjust the codes in order to they can work on server.
#### Day 17
Accord the video to learn the httpservlet and genericservlet,and try to write the sample code on the video.
#### Day 18
Code my own Httpservlet and Genericservlet according to the video tutorial,in the process of writing not a video tutorial I have read more or less three times,it feels more and more difficult.
#### Day 19
Today,I learned how to connect a servlet programm to a database and encountered a permissions issue.Locally,the user is an ordinary user,but MySQL is possessed by the root user,and I haven't solved the problem yet.
#### Day 21
Today,I have learned the principle of the JSP file,it is essentially a servlet program,in the execution of the JSP engine to compile it into a servlet program.
#### Day 23
As of today,I have looked at a large part of the JSP and expect to be able to finish it learning tomorrow.Today,I realized the login successfully display pop-up window,but JSP script writing I am not quite clear,there is a diffculty has not been resovled,look forward to tomorrow can be resolved.
Tips:
user:tomcat pass:tomcat
#### Day 24
I haven't finished the code,as it is the focus,so I have to look at the tutorial carefully.I've uploaded some code,but I didn't update the README.md.
#### Day 25 
I finished the JSP tutorial.It it more important for the behind content,so it took me twice times to look at tutorials and write code.
* All the home site is http://120.79.133.21:8080/LoginServlet/*.jsp
#### Day 26
Now,I have learned JavaWEB_include directive.These chapters are relatively simple,but in order to learn these chapters I have recreated a project that I will deploy to Aliyun.
#### Day 27
The task I finished today was to complete the JSP tutorials.Now I'm summing up a few inportant conclusions:
* First,the forwarding of the request is based on request,the method is request.getRequestDispatcher(path).forward(request,response);
* Second,the redirection of the request is based on response,the method is response.sendRedirect(path);
* Third,the scope of the four elements of pageContext,request,session,application is small to large and important and they can call methods related to the getAttribute method.These methods all belong to Object objects.
* Forth,There are instructions that can be placed at the first of the JSP to configure the JSP page.Similarly,there are some JSP tags that can be configured with JSP pages.
* The end,all the home site is http://120.79.133.21:8080/web/*.jsp
#### Day 30
I started to learn MVC tutorial,It is a design pattern we're going to follow when we design.Unlike the previous one,the code for this linked database does not need to do anything else,just control.
* New site is http://120.79.133.21:8080/MVCTutorial/test.jsp
